    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to support a real-time, multi-player score system (ScoreSync). The primary collection is `players`, which stores individual player documents. Each player document contains the player's `name`. The `history` collection stores all score entries, linked to a player via `playerId`. This ensures a strong, relational link between a player and their scores. The total score is calculated on the client-side by aggregating the `points` from the `history` collection. This avoids data redundancy and ensures the score is always consistent with the history. Security rules control access, and Firestore queries with `orderBy` will be used for ranking."
