/**
 * This ruleset enforces a public, read-only security model for a real-time scoreboard application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The primary goal is to allow any user (authenticated or anonymous) to view player scores,
 * supporting features like public leaderboards. However, to maintain data integrity, all direct
 * client-side writes to player scores are currently disallowed. This creates a secure-by-default
 * posture, assuming that score updates will be handled by a trusted backend service or Cloud Function.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All player data is stored in a single top-level collection: /players/{playerId}.
 * This flat structure is simple and performant for querying and listing all players.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public Read Access: The /players collection is publicly readable to anyone to facilitate a global scoreboard.
 * - Write Operations Disabled: Direct client-side creation, updates, and deletion of player documents are
 *   explicitly disabled. This is a critical security measure because the 'Player' entity in the data model
 *   lacks an 'ownerId' or 'creatorId' field, making it impossible to securely authorize which user is
 *   allowed to modify a specific score.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The current ruleset is simple and does not require denormalization. However, if write access were to be
 * enabled, it would be critical to add an ownership field (e.g., 'ownerId') directly to each 'Player' document.
 * This would allow for a simple, performant rule like 'allow update: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.ownerId;'
 * without needing costly 'get()' calls to other documents.
 *
