    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to support a real-time, multi-player score system (ScoreSync). It prioritizes simplicity, security, and real-time updates using Firebase.  It uses a single collection for players. The structure facilitates efficient queries for ranking and provides a clear security model.\n\n**Authorization Independence:** The design does not require authorization checks that rely on hierarchical data (`get()` calls in rules). All necessary data for validating operations is present within each document, which is especially important for atomic operations and managing data consistency.\n\n**QAPs Support:**\n*   Secure `list` operations are supported by the segregation of player data into its own collection. This ensures that `list` operations can be performed securely with rules applied at the collection level.\n*   The design uses path-based ownership for global data, enforcing that write access is restricted based on rule definitions (admin role or updates to individual scores).\n\n**Invariants:**\n*   The structure supports the integrity of scores by allowing score updates only through increments controlled by rules.\n*   The name is assumed to be unique and invariant."
