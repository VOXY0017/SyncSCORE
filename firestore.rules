/**
 * This ruleset enforces a public read and write security model.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The goal is to allow any user (authenticated or not) to view and modify player scores.
 * This is suitable for a simple, public scoreboard where no sensitive data is stored
 * and where accidental or malicious data modification is not a major concern.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public Read/Write Access: The entire 'players' collection and its subcollections
 *   are publicly readable and writable by anyone. This is the simplest possible
 *   configuration but offers no data protection.
