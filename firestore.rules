/**
 * This ruleset enforces a completely public security model.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The goal is to allow any user (authenticated or not) to read, write, update,
 * and delete any data. This is suitable for a simple, public scoreboard where
 * no sensitive data is stored and where open collaboration is desired.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public Read/Write Access: The entire 'players' collection and all its
 *   subcollections are publicly readable and writable by anyone. This offers
 *   no data protection but provides maximum accessibility.
